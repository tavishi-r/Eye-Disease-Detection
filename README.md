# Eye-Disease-Detection


This repository contains an image detection model for testing eye diseases, including cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and normal eyes. The model was built using BERT and TensorFlow, with all model training, testing, and visualization included. The model's performance is integrated into a Flask-based web application for user interaction.
